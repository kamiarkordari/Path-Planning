#  Path Planning Project
The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth and safe trajectories for a self-driving car to follow.

### Goals
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The planner is provided with the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible. Other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

### Path planner

##### Point Paths
The path planner outputs a list of x and y global map coordinates. Each pair of x and y coordinates is a point, and all of the points together form a trajectory.

Every 20 ms the car moves to the next point on the list. The car's new rotation becomes the line between the previous waypoint and the car's new location.

In `main.cpp`, we pass next_x_vals, and next_y_vals that contains the point of the trajectory to the simulator.

##### Velocity
The velocity of the car depends on the spacing of the points. Because the car moves to a new waypoint every 20ms, the larger the spacing between points, the faster the car will travel. The speed goal is to have the car traveling at (but not above) the 50 MPH speed limit as often as possible.

##### Jerk
The jerk is calculated as the average acceleration over 1 second intervals. In order for the passenger to have an enjoyable ride both the jerk and the total acceleration should not exceed 10 m/s^2.

We minimize total acceleration and jerk by gradually increasing and decreasing point path spacing based on the `car_speed` variable.

### Creating paths
The path planner builds a 50 poin path. At each new calculation cycle, the code starts the new path with whatever waypoints from the previous path. Then it appends new waypoints based on new data from the car's sensor fusion information until the new path has 50 total waypoints. This ensures that there is a smooth transition from cycle to cycle.

##### Timing
The simulator runs a cycle every 20 ms (50 frames per second). The car will keep moving along the last path given by the path planning code while it waits for a new generated path. The new generated path takes into account the most up-to-date state of the traffic and location of other cars.

Incorporating previous points becomes even more important if there is a delay in sending the new path to the controller. As long as the new path incorporates a sufficient number of points from the previous path the transition will be smooth.

##### Highway Map
Inside `data/highway_map.csv` there is a list of waypoints that go all the way around the track. The track contains a total of 181 waypoints, with the last waypoint mapping back around to the first. The waypoints are in the middle of the double-yellow dividing line in the center of the highway.

The track is 6945.554 meters around (about 4.32 miles). At 50 MPH, then it takes a little more than 5 minutes for the car to go all the way around the highway.

The highway has 6 lanes total - 3 heading in each direction. Each lane is 4 meters wide and the car should only ever be in one of the 3 lanes on the right-hand side. The car should always be inside a lane unless doing a lane change.

##### Localization
Each waypoint has an (x,y) global map position, and a Frenet s value and Frenet d unit normal vector (split up into the x component, and the y component).

The s value is the distance along the direction of the road. The first waypoint has an s value of 0 because it is the starting point.

The d vector has a magnitude of 1 and points perpendicular to the road in the direction of the right-hand side of the road. The d vector can be used to calculate lane positions. For example, since the lane is 4 m wide, the middle of the left lane (the lane closest to the double-yellow dividing line) is 2 m from the waypoint.

##### Converting Frenet Coordinates
The helper function `getXY`takes in Frenet (s,d) coordinates and transforms them to (x,y) coordinates.

##### Interpolating Points
To estimate the location of points between the known waypoints, we "interpolate" the position of those points using [spline tool](https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) for C++, contained in just a single header file.



### Sensor Fusion
It's important that the car doesn't crash into any of the other vehicles on the road, all of which are moving at different speeds around the speed limit and can change lanes.

The `sensor_fusion` variable contains all the information about the cars on the right-hand side of the road.

The data format for each car is: `[id, x, y, vx, vy, s, d]`. The id is a unique identifier for that car. The x, y values are in global map coordinates, and the vx, vy values are the velocity components, also in reference to the global map. Finally s and d are the Frenet coordinates for that car.





#### Simulator.
You can download the Simulator [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  


#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
